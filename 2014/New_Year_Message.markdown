This is just a quick note to thank you for all your help with deliveries over the past year: it is really encouraging that there is such a strong team of active Conservative supporters in Knebworth.

I'd just like to mention that I was recently selected as the Conservative candidate for the Knebworth Knebworth Ward for the forthcoming District Council elections. I am very proud to have been selected and I look forward to continue the important work of delivering leaflets in the New Year.
