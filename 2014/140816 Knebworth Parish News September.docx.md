**NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – SEPTEMBER UPDATE**

**Solar Farm Proposals affecting Knebworth**

There are now two proposals for Solar Farms in Knebworth Parish, one at the junction of Swangley's Lane and Baines Lane at the eastern boundary of the parish towards Datchworth (planning application received by NHDC, developer: Solstice Renewables) and the other between Three Houses Lane and Node Wood in the west part of the parish west of the B656 and just north of Codicote (no planning application received by NHDC as at mid-August, developer: Lightsource Renewable Energy).

The details of the individual proposals will differ, but, essentially, involve covering much of the existing fields with solar panels, fixed on metal frames, installing an inverter building (about the size of a container), and connecting the latter to the grid. Each scheme would cover 50 acres or so, and a number of these developments have been proposed in nearby parishes, including Graveley and Langley – the flurry of activity may be linked to the current subsidy levels, which are due to change in April 2015.

Fully validated applications for the two solar farms are likely to have been accepted by the Planning Authority, NHDC, by September. In the case of the Swangley's Farm site, a 'screening opinion' has already been received and approved. This is a preliminary enquiry to determine what documents must accompany the application. The approval of this screening opinion application does not have any bearing on whether the development application itself will be approved.

When it comes to the application itself, this must be decided in the light of the National Planning Policy Framework, specifically Paragraph 91 which states:

> *When located in the Green Belt, elements of many renewable energy projects will comprise inappropriate development. In such cases developers will need to demonstrate very special circumstances if projects are to proceed. Such very special circumstances may include the wider environmental benefits associated with increased production of energy from renewable sources.*

and the Planning Practice Guidance for Renewable and Low-carbon Energy, Para 15:

> *In shaping local criteria for inclusion in Local Plans and considering planning applications in the meantime, it is important to be clear that: The need for renewable or low carbon energy does not automatically override environmental protections...\[five other paragraphs relating to what must be considered in these applications\].*

The Parish Council is a consultee in this process and will be invited to comment on the application to NHDC in the light of these planning rules. You (as residents of Knebworth) should contact the Parish Council if you have views about the appropriateness of these developments. You may also submit your comments directly to NHDC or via me, as one of your district councillors. The planning process for these farms is likely to take until late October or early November, so there is still plenty of time to become involved in the consultation process.

Planning law in this area is complex and cannot be covered fully in the space available here.
