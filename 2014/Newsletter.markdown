**Your Local Campaigner Working for You**
=========================================

Prospective candidate for Knebworth Ward on North Hertfordshire District Council
Steve Hemingway will need no introduction to many of you, as a resident of Knebworth for 30 years living in the centre of the village. Steve is directly involved in representing the community, serving as a Parish Councillor since 2010, and as chair of the Planning Committee since 2011.
Steve is involved in a variety of local groups, such as the Knebworth walking group and Twinning Association, and is a frequent supporter of community activities such as the Knebworth Festival and performances by KATS, the Knebworth Players and Community Chorus.
"Knebworth is a sustainable community, and an excellent place to live,", says Steve, "however, it needs strong representation in forums where it is competing for resources with other communities in the District and beyond."

Brownfield Development in Knebworth
-----------------------------------

No doubt you are aware of imminent redevelopment of several sites that are scheduled for redevelopment. These present an opportunity to create additional accommodation for Knebworth residents who may want to downsize, and for younger people who currently find it very expensive to buy property here. There are opportunities to negotiate with the developers to obtain funding for useful projects locally out of the gains realised by these developers.

As the housing market recovers it is likely that other sites will be put forward for development. By being pro-active in negotiating with developers the best outcome for all is most likely to be obtained.

Parking
-------

The railway station brings many benefits to Knebworth, but it also brings pressure on parking. The same applies to increased employment in businesses dotted around the village, but particularly in the area of London Road. The Knebworth Parking Initiative Group has worked hard to reduce problem parking, but there is still a lot of work to do. There are a number of smallish sites around the village where additional parking could be located. Mike Moult has done a study for KPIG, which is working hard to get this additional capacity into use.

Cricket Club
------------

The Knebworth Park Cricket Club is one of the most successful in Hertfordshire. For a village club it runs a huge number of teams, both adult and junior. It currently occupies a site where is has only two pitches, at least one fewer than it needs. An application has been made to create a new site, also within Knebworth Park. The Park is a valuable amenity for the village and making changes to it without proper consultation would be a mistake. Plans for the proposal are available on the District Council and Parish Council websites.

Knebworth in the Digital Age
----------------------------

The Knebworth Village Website has a useful community directory as well as local news. Jo Simson's weekly newsletter appears in it. Knebworth House website has extensive information about the house and park, as well as the many events that are held there during the year. Communities and individuals with links to Knebworth exist on Facebook and Twitter.

The existence of these digital forums has not spelled the end of more traditional media: most of the village still receives the Comet, and the Parish News continues to be delivered around the village by volunteers every month.

Local Shops
-----------

The local shops in Knebworth are under great competitive pressures from large supermarkets in Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City as well as smaller outlets in Oaklands. The decision to charge from the first minute for parking in the St Martins Road car park is, in my view, a mistake. I have joined the campaign to allow users of this car park to have the first thirty minutes free of charge, to encourage use of local shops and facilities.

GP Surgery
----------

There have been a number of proposals for a new site for the GP surgery in Knebworth over the years. It is clear that the building is less than ideal but so far no perfect site has been identified, which is a great pity. I will support a suitable site as long as it is readily accessible and sufficiently large for the ageing population of Knebworth. A proposal was put forward to use the site currently occupied by the Library but this is no longer under consideration.

Norton Green Common
-------------------

Norton Green is a hamlet is on the very edge of the Parish. It is next to a common, Norton Green Common, which is currently rather neglected, in spite of being part of the Knebworth Sites of Special Scientific Interest ('SSSI's). The Parish Council have been campaigning for a proper plan to be drawn up for the management of Norton Green Common for a number of years. Although the progress is slow, some results are being achieved and there is a good prospect of the Common becoming an even more valuable part of the green hinterland of Knebworth.

Planning
--------

The planning system is supposed to balance the well being of residents against the rights of land owners to put their property to the most beneficial use. The District Council has the important function of balancing these interests in its capacity as the Planning Authority. Of course, the Council is heavily constrained by the planning policies laid down by central government, but still has an obligation to produce a local plan, within which new development can take place.

I have long taken a keen interest in this function, and indeed am the Chair of the Planning Committee of the Parish Council. I will continue with this interest and will oppose plans that permit development which I consider would be detrimental, on balance, to existing residents. I believe that there would be advantages in developing a Neighbourhood Plan and even in the Parish Council becoming its own Planning Authority.

Preservation of the Environment
===============================

Knebworth is surrounded by fields which are criss-crossed with a network of various public rights of way: byways, bridleways and footpaths. I am a keen walker both as a member of organised walking groups and just as a way to enjoy the countryside with my dogs. Encouraging access to the countryside is a great and nearly-free way to improve the health and well-being of residents which I strongly support. \[County is responsible for RoW, but does the District do anything to maintain footpaths etc.?\]

Parking
=======

The influence of the railway station on Knebworth is huge. Easy access to London and Cambridge and to intermediate stations is a great advantage to residents. I personally commuted into London for work for many years, and believe that commuters are entitled to a return on their Council Tax too. As in my case, when commuters are able to spend less time on the train they often find the have more time they can spend on community activities.

The station, however, is not an unmixed blessing. It gives rise to extra parking on streets which are within walking distance of the station, which, in reality, means almost the whole of 'New Knebworth'. As a member of KPIG I am well aware that there is no magic bullet which will solve everyone's problems, but I believe that incremental measures can keep the problem contained. The recent parking restrictions are an example of such a measure, the first (for a long time) of many. I will continue as a member of KPIG to work towards better parking in Knebworth.

Localism
========

I am strongly in favour of political power being delegated downwards towards voters to the extent where this is practically possible. This will improve accountability of elected representatives and be fundamentally more democratic.

Anti Social Behaviour
=====================

Knebworth does not have a serious problem with muggings or vandalism or drug use, but it is not immune to problems and in the absence of continued vigilance problems are likely to increase. I support the right of individuals to a private life, but I do not feel that CCTV and Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras on the public highway degrade that right materially. I do not believe that a heavy presence of police or even the presence of police support officers is justified.

Local Presence
==============

I have served as a Parish Councillor since 2010 and intend to continue serving in that capacity. Even though I live in the village and spend a lot of time there my continued membership of the Parish Council will allow me to continue to be closely in touch with the local community.

Internet
========

As someone who has worked for many years as a software developer I am acutely aware of the shortcomings of the District Council to to take anything like full advantage of modern technology. The council operates on an analogue model in a digital age and by doing so alienates younger cohorts of residents. Although I recognise that there will be strong opposition from elected members of all parties, I will campaign for the council to make increased use of digital technologies. I also support increased broadband speeds throughout the Knebworth Ward.af

Transport Links
===============

Knebworth is well-connected on a north-south access via the A1(M) and the East Coast Main Line. However the both the B197 and the railway station at Knebworth are constricting access to these arteries. Also the east-west roads through Knebworth â€“ Park Land and Watton Road suffer from severe congestion which is beginning to affect the quality of live of residents of the village, and, no doubt, the saleability of their houses.

The district council cannot build new roads, but it can block new developments while transport links are inadequate and it can lobby the higher tiers of government. I would do these things.
