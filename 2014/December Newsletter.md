NHDC Waste Collection
=====================

David Percival in last month's Parish News stated that "contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village". I contacted the officer at NHDC responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the contract:

"The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this problem.  

We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I have copied \[the relevant officer\] in who will be about to check some of the streets in Knebworth over the next few collections.

It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service. If residents notice any problems they can contact the NHDC helpdesk on 0800 328 6023 who will monitor the level of complaints from Knebworth. Alternatively feel free to contact me about this directly.

Application to redevelop the GP Surgery at 1 Stevenage Road
===========================================================

I had a meeting about the future of the Knebworth Surgery of the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice on the 24th October. The practice manager, Ken Spooner, Graham Fothergill, member of the PPG, Stephen McPartland, MP, Richard Thake, county councillor attended the meeting. Richard Thake agreed to negotiate with his colleagues at County Hall to make the library site, in St Martin's Road, available. Stephen McPartland agreed to negotiate with the Clinical Commissioning Group to ensure that funds would be available to fund the development of a new surgery on that site.

Knebworth Park Cricket Club
===========================

On 13th November I addressed the Planning Control Committee at the District Council Offices, objecting to the application to develop two new cricket pitches and a clubhouse on Jubilee Field (currently occupied by the Pony Club) in Old Knebworth. The committee voted to defer consideration of the development because of late submission of a revised design of the pavilion and a late submission of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is expected that the application will be re-considered at the meeting on 18th December.

111 London Road Application
===========================

I spoke against the application at the Planning Control Committee on the 16th October. Although the application was not accepted on that occasion, the developer subsequently made some changes, including the addition of two parking spaces and a contribution to affordable housing in the District with the result that the committee accepted it at the following meeting.

Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation Order
=======================================================================

I will be meeting with Transport Officers at NHDC on Monday 17th November. Unfortunately this is too late to allow me to report on the outcome of the consultation on Control Parking Zones in the village. I will summarize the recommendations in my next report.

Solar Farms
===========

The Swangley's Lane solar PV application was due to be discussed at the meeting on the 13th November. On the 10th, the officer wrote to me to advise me that it has been withdrawn on the basis that the applicant had written to the planning officers "setting out additional proposals to mitigate the impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt ." This will now be discussed at the planning meeting on the 18th December.

The solar PV installation at Three Houses Lane has been delayed because of some errors in the original application. No date is yet scheduled for it to come before the committee.

North Hertfordshire Local Plan  
================================

NHDC is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but will include the publication of the "Preferred Options", i.e. sites which the council have put forward as suitable for development. Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place from early December through to the first week of February (these are provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about the proposals will be available in the Library and on the NHDC website.

Norton Green Common
===================

I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Clerk.
