He is involved in a variety of local community activities such as the Knebworth walking group and Knebworth Twinning Association, as well as frequently supporting local events such as the Knebworth Festival and performances by KATS and the Knebworth Community Chorus.

Steve has been directly involved in representing the community serving as a Parish Councillor since 2010, and as chair of the Planning Committee since 2011, the year he became involved in the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group (KPIG). He has been a governor at Roebuck Primary School in Broadwater, Stevenage since 2006, and previously was a assistant cub-scout leader in Knebworth Cubs.

If elected as Councillor for the Knebworth Ward I will work hard on the Council to stand up for the best interests of village residents and in the surrounding area. I will be responsive and available to villagers to hear their opinions and concerns, in person, by telephone and via email. I intend to work closely with the Parish Council and stand for election as a Parish Councillor in the forthcoming elections.
