<h1>Swangley's Farm Solar PV</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The proposed solar farm at Swangley's Farm has been 'called
in'. It will be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for
Communities and Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990,
Section 70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be examined by
the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is not clear how long
this process will take.</p>

<h1>NHDC Council Tax</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal> At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided
to increase its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or £3.88 for a Band D
property in Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District
Council becomes £208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is
made up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order of
increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us all.</p>

<h1>Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan.
Responses must be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you
to comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun Meadow Avenue
and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of proposals along the B197
which will have an impact on Knebworth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a Local Plan drop-in Consultation Event for the
Welhat Plan on 7th March at Hatfield Hub, 56, Town Centre, Hatfield, AL10 0JJ. 
For further information contact the Welwyn Hatfield Planning Policy Team on
01707 357 000 or at planningpolicy@welhat.gov.uk.</p>
