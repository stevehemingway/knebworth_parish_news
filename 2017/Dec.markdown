# Brown Bins

NHDC has agreed a new contract, jointly with 

  * The charge for brown bin connection will not fully offset the cost of collection,
  * NHDC has no alternative to make savings of £4.2m by 2021,
  * 54% of local authorities in England and Wales charge for garden waste collection already,
  * From May, food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an improvement in the level of service compared to today,
  * garden composters of a range of sizes may be ordered from the NHDC website. These are not free, but are heavily discounted compared to a commercial supplier. Composting waste in one's own garden is better for the environment than having it taken by diesel-guzzling trucks to Rushden in the north of the District.
 
## Bin collection over the holiday period

The pattern of collections for bins will be the same as in previous years: bins will be collected on Thursday 28th in Christmas Week and the 4th Jan in the New Year Week. They will be collected on Wed the 10th in the following week before returning to normal on the 16th Jan. The second week will look at the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and the spatial distribution of new housing. None of these sessions will examine the allocations to individual sites. This will be examined in Week 6 of the enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the morning of Monday 26th Feb. These sessions are all open to the public and are held in the Icknield Centre in Letchworth.

# Local Plan

The Examination in Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th Nov. The first week covered strategic matters, such as the duty of NHDC to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to Luton). It also took evidence on the deliverability of the plan and the 'high level' issues: i.e. without any reference to individual sites.

The specific allocations for Knebworth is due to to be examined on the morning of the 26th February. All sessions are open to the public and are held at the Icknield Centre, on Icknield Way in Letchworth. Landowners and objectors will have an opportunity to present their cases to the Inspector, Mr Simon Berkeley.
