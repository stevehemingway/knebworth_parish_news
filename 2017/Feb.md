**NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – FEBRUARY UPDATE**

## **NHDC Community Grants – Last meeting for 2016/17 Civic Year**
The last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year will be on 2^nd^ March, but applications must be made a few weeks before so please don’t delay if you wish to apply for a grant this year. We like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year and there is still money available. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at NHDC for more details. The application form is available via NHDC’s website. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from NHDC, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups made up predominantly of Knebworth residents may also apply to the Knebworth Village Trust.

## **Raising Community Funds to save The Station Pub **

The Station Pub is up for sale and help is needed to raise funds to buy it for the community. The Parish Council is looking into possibilities for funding, see their article in this edition for more details, and has started the process to register the pub as an asset of community value with NHDC, which will give extra time for the village to raise funds.

Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: The Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty-six years after being purchased by the community.

## So, if you think you can help in any way, now or later, please be in touch. 

## **Planning applications with potential impact for Knebworth**
The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is out of character with the surrounding buildings and having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the decision.

A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation website.
