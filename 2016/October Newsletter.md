The NHDC Cabinet met on [insert exact date in Sept] and approved the Draft Local Plan Submission public consultation. This is a 'submission' because it includes the 'evidence base' which is required by the Planning Inspector to assess whether or not the plan is 'sound'. 

There is now a narrow window of opportunity for residents of the district to make their representations. This time to the Planning Inspector (**not** to NHDC this time). The Inspector will be examining the plan to ensure that it must:

- be based on a strategy which seeks to meet objectively assessed development and infrastructure requirements,
- be based on a robust and credible evidence base involving evidence of participation of the local community and others having a stake in the area,
- have evidence of sound infrastructure delivery planning,
- be deliverable,
- be consistent with national policy, which includes the requirement that it be sustainable, and that it comply with the requirement that only in exceptional circumstances should development take place in the Green Belt.


The NPPF defines sustainable development as:

    Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is central to the economic, environmental and social success of the country and is the core principle underpinning planning. Simply stated, the principle recognises the importance of ensuring that all people should be able to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life, both now and in the future.
## New Settlement

NHDC have worked with Advisory Team for Large Applications of the Homes and Communities Agency on the options available for satisfying housing needs via a so-called New Settlement. The conclusion is that the planning of this would take too long for it to be deliverable as part of the current plan process. Sadly, we are already well into the plan period (2011-2031) and no real work has been done on assessment of sites.

The three MPs whose constituencies overlap the North Herts District are on record as preferring a Local Plan based on a new settlement, built outside of the existing Green Belt.

## Green Belt

The Green Belt in Hertfordshire is mainly the Metropolitan one, around London. Part of it is the one surrounding Luton. None of the towns in the district has it's 'own' Green Belt, although the NPPF principles require the avoidance of coalescence of settlements. The large bulk of development sites in the draft plan will be in what is now Green Belt. The plan provides for moving the boundary of the Green Belt to allow the building of the various edge of settlement sites.

## Luton

The planning guidance puts on local authorities a duty to cooperate with neighbouring authorities whose 'objectively assessed need' cannot be satisfied within their own settlement boundaries. Sites for around two thousand dwellings are included in the plan to meet Luton's unmet need, around the village of Cockernhoe, to the east of Luton.  This is a very contentious location, but if NHDC were shown to have failed to meet their duty to cooperate, their plan would be immediately dismissed.
