Organise your own litter pick
We recognise that community groups including schools, Scout and Guide groups, adult organisations such as WI and Rotary Clubs, and annual organised community clean ups add a huge amount of value to looking after and improving our local environment.
If you are part of a community group, school or are organising a community 'tidy up', we have developed a toolkit you can download from this page to help you plan and run your community litter pick successfully.
We also have litter picking and graffiti removal equipment available to loan, free of charge, to community groups on request. Please note: equipment is available to borrow on a first come first serve basis and we will require a completed equipment booking form and a minimum of two weeks notice before your event to organise equipment.
For more information please contact the Waste team on 0800 328 6023 and request to speak to a Waste Services Officer.


Council Tax - go paperless (Council Tax -> "Your Council Tax Bill"). If you have lost the paper copy of your bill, you can get an electronic copy (as long as you know your Council Tax Reference Number). 

The North Herts Museum is now partially open, with Tuesday - Saturday 10:30 - 16:30. It houses various local collections, as well as regular exhibitions. 13 Jan - 3rd March: Louis Wain (artist) "Curious Cats". The museum is next to Hitchin Town Hall, in Brand Street, Hitchin. Although its ability to stage exhibitions is somewhat hampered by the fact that the entrance at 14-15 Brand Street has still not been brought into use, it is open to the public. It is hoping that dispute that is preventing the use of this entrance will soon be resolved.

I have had some feedback about the new charging regime for garden waste bins, not all of it favourable. It is important to remember that removal of household waste is a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it is allowed to charge for. Some residents have complained about the fact that they will receive another container for their waste, the new larger sized caddy for food waste. The alternative to this was to let householders put their food waste in their 'residual waste' (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was felt that it was a less good solution from a environmental point of view and was rejected. Householders who pay for garden waste bins may continue to use them for food waste, leaving their new food caddies unused, however they will then have their food waste removed only ever fortnight, rather than every week.

There was some confusion over what I meant when I said that it would be possible to order additional brown bins. Each bin will attract the £40 annual charge. The change is that up until now each householder was allowed one brown bin without reference to the size of his or her garden.

This month, on the 21st Jan, will see the meeting of the NHDC Cabinet at which it is expected that a revenue budget and capital spending programme will be produced. These items will be referred to full Council on 8 February 2018. Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the NHDC website for details of the the location as the District Council Offices in Gernon Road are out of action during refurbishment, which is expected to be finished before the end of the first quarter.
