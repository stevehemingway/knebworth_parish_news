## Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area

I went to open the Environmental Area in Knebworth JMI on 23rd March. It is a wonderful facility, with all sorts of wildlife, including a pond with frogspawn as well as a wide range of teaching resources for outdoor learning. The opening celebrated the work of Alena Evans and others who contributed to refurbishing the area which had become very neglected and run down. There are many photos of the area on Facebook: just search for "Knebworth Primary and Nursery School."

## Verge Parking

There has been a rise in anti-social parking on verges in the village. There are no easy solutions to parking in the village, but taking the law into one's own hands will make a difficult situation worse. In some cases bollards, as installed by Herts Highways may be a solution, but this will not work where existing crossovers exist.

## Self-Build and Custom Build Register

As of 31 Oct 2016, NHDC have been obliged to maintain a register of local residents interested in building their own houses.  The council has a legal obligation to grant sufficient development permissions to satisfy local need. This needs to be done within three years, so the sooner you sign up the quicker NHDC will have to offer you a site within the District. For more information go to https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/self-build-and-custom-build-register or just search for 'self-build' at the search box.

## Community Facilities Capital Grants Fund

NHDC allocated &pound;1.2 million for grants to local village halls, community halls and related facilities. Last year &pound;32,000 was allocated to Knebworth Scouts and Guides. Another &pound;250,000 is likely to be allocated in 2018-2019 so if you think you have a suitable project, please contact NHDC on 01462 747000 or search for "capital projects fund" in the search box.

## Southern Rural Grant Funding Spared

A decision to cease Area Committee Grants was deferred at the NHDC meeting in February, which means that Southern Rural will once again get its share of this funding, which totals &pound;90,000 in total across five area committees. Charities, voluntary groups and not-for-profit organisations may apply for these grants. The grant can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.

Southern Rural meets four times a year, in June, September, December and March. Now is the time to start filling in an application form. The deadline for the June meeting is 5pm on Friday 4th May. Search for "area committee grants" on the NHDC website to find out more, or call 01462 747000.


## Examination in Public of the NHDC Local Plan

The public hearings at which the Local Plan was subject to rigorous examination by all interested parties came to an end on 27th March. NHDC have a large number of actions to take before the Inspector produces his 'main modifications' to the Plan, which will remedy the defects in it which have come to light. Search for "examination actions" on the website for more information.

A further six weeks of consultation will be allocated for public consultation on these main modifications. The provision of school places was considered to be of particular importance for Knebworth.

## Double Yellow Line consultations for Gun Lane and Park Lane

Herts County Council is consulting on the proposed additional double yellow lines in Gun Lane and Park Lane.
