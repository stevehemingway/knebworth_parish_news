## Garden Waste Bins

I have had some feedback about the new charging regime for garden waste bins. It is important to remember that removal of household waste is a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it is allowed to charge for. Some residents have complained about the fact that they will receive another container for their waste, the new larger sized caddy for food waste. The alternative to this was to let householders put their food waste in their 'residual waste' (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was felt that it was a less good solution from a environmental point of view and was rejected. Householders who pay for garden waste bins may continue to use them for food waste, leaving their new food caddies unused, however they will then have their food waste removed only ever fortnight, rather than every week.

There was some confusion over what I meant when I said that it would be possible to order additional brown bins. Each bin will attract the 40 pounds annual charge. The change is that up until now each householder was allowed one brown bin without reference to the size of his or her garden.

## Forthcoming NHDC meetings

This month, on the 21st Jan, will see the meeting of the NHDC Cabinet at which it is expected that a revenue budget and capital spending programme will be produced. These items will be referred to full Council on 8 February 2018. Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the NHDC website for details of the the location as the District Council Offices in Gernon Road are out of action during refurbishment, which is expected to be finished before the end of the first quarter.

## Establishment of a Council Housing Company

NHDC no longer owns any housing stock, having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in 2004. However, it remains responsible for homelessness, and has a number of housing offers responsible for assisting homeless persons in the District. Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), it is a serious problem. In order to deal with this problem the Council is looking into establishing a Housing Company that will own residential housing that will be made available to the homeless. Currenly, in some cases, families have to be housed in bed and breakfast accommodation in adjacent boroughs. A decision on this is expected to be taken in a Cabinet subcommittee some time this month. It is likely that the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 will increase the load on NHDC in this area.
