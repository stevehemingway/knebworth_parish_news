District.

8.4 Cabinet has recommended an increase of £5.00 in the council tax rate
for 2017/18 for NHDC purposes. This will result in a Band D equivalent
tax rate of £216.96. The tax base has been estimated at 48,648.70 and so
the precept requirement for NHDC purposes is £10,554,822.

8.5 The NHDC precept requirement is added to the local precepting
authorities’ requirement to calculate the District council tax
requirement. This is £11,622,673.

**9. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**

1.  The provision for the Authority to levy and collect a Council tax is
    provided in section 30 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992
    (Aggregating Billing Authority and Preceptors Council Tax Charges).

2.  The principles for referendums relating to council tax increases
    were announced in the provisional Local Government finance
    settlement on 15th December 2016 and do not apply to the local
    precepting authorities.

3.  Council is asked to note the precepts and approve the total District
    Council Tax Requirement for inclusion in the Council Tax resolution.
    It is the responsibility of the Council Tax Setting Committee to set
    the Council Tax Base and set the Council Tax in accordance with the
    relevant legislation (see paragraph 10.2 of the Council’s
    Constitution).

**10. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**

10.1 We are required to calculate and include in the formal council tax
resolution the District Council Tax requirement, which comprises the
District Council’s budget requirement and that of any parishes in the
area. This figure is then combined with the precept requirements from
the major precepting bodies, Hertfordshire County Council and
Hertfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner, to arrive at the total
Council Tax amount due.

10.2 The approval of the formal Council Tax resolution by the Council
Tax Setting Committee is scheduled to take place on the 23 February 2017
and will authorise the Council Tax billing of the residents of North
Hertfordshire for financial year 2017/18.

**11. RISK IMPLICATIONS**

11.1 The risk of non-collection of council tax is monitored in the
Collection Fund. The tax base calculations have assumed a non-collection
rate of 1%.

**12. EQUALITIES IMPLICATIONS**

12.1 The Equality Act 2010 came into force on the 1<sup>st</sup> October
2010, a major piece of legislation. The Act also created a new Public
Sector Equality Duty, which came into force on the 5<sup>th</sup> April
2011. There is a General duty, described in 12.2, that public bodies
must meet, underpinned by more specific duties which are designed to
help meet them.

2.  In line with the Public Sector Equality Duty, public bodies must, in
    the exercise of its functions, give **due regard** to the need to
    eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation, to advance
    equality of opportunity and foster good relations between those who
    share a protected characteristic and those who do not.

3.  The review and setting of Council Tax is a statutory responsibility
    of this Council. A balance must be considered and demonstrated by
    the Council when setting the level of Council Tax and any rise or
    fall in tax. This said balance is between the ability of the
    individual residents’ to pay the required Council Tax and the
    Council’s need to have sufficient base budget to deliver key
    services across the District. The recommendation to provide a grant
    of approximately £39,000 to the District’s Town and Parish Councils
    will mitigate the impact of the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. This
    action reflects some of the considerations made in reaching this
    balance.

**13. SOCIAL VALUE IMPLICATIONS**

13.1 There are no direct social value implications.

**14. HUMAN RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS**

14.1 There are no direct human resource implications arising.

**15. APPENDICES**

15.1 None.
