1.  **REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS**
    
    1.  To ensure that all relevant factors are taken into consideration
        when arriving at the proposed Council Tax precept for 2018/19.

2.  **ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS CONSIDERED**
    
    1.  None.

3.  **CONSULTATION WITH RELEVANT MEMBERS AND EXTERNAL ORGANISATIONS**
    
    1.  Parish and Town Councils were asked to provide notice of their
        precept requirements by the 19 January 2018 in order that there
        could be consideration of the total District Council Tax
        Requirement at this meeting.

4.  **FORWARD PLAN**
    
    1.  This report contains a recommendation on a key decision that was
        first notified to the public in the Forward Plan on the 28 July
        2017.

5.  **BACKGROUND**
    
    1.  The referral from Cabinet details the recommendation to increase
        Council Tax by 2.99% and the workings behind the North
        Hertfordshire District Council (NHDC) precept, for its own
        purposes, of £10,975,529.

6.  **RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS**
    
    1.  The Parish and Town Councils have provided notification of the
        precepts they wish to levy for 2018/19. It was agreed at the
        January meeting of this Council to distribute a total of £38,885
        to the local precepting authorities as the amount of Council Tax
        Reduction Scheme Grant for 2018/19. This will be paid to each
        authority in addition to their precept demand, as detailed in
        table 1 below. The total precept demand of £1,095,531 will be
        levied on the relevant Council Tax base of the District.

1.  **LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**
    
    1.  The provision for the Authority to levy and collect a Council
        tax is provided in section 30 of the Local Government Finance
        Act 1992 (Aggregating Billing Authority and Preceptors Council
        Tax Charges).
    
    2.  The principles for referendums relating to Council Tax increases
        were announced in the provisional Local Government finance
        settlement on 19th December 2017 and do not apply to the local
        precepting authorities.
    
    3.  Council is asked to note the precepts and approve the total
        District Council Tax Requirement for inclusion in the Council
        Tax resolution. It is the responsibility of the Council Tax
        Setting Committee to set the Council Tax Base and set the
        Council Tax in accordance with the relevant legislation (see
        paragraph 10.2 of the Council’s Constitution).

2.  **FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**
    
    1.  We are required to calculate and include in the formal council
        tax resolution the District Council Tax requirement, which
        comprises the District Council’s budget requirement and that of
        any parishes in the area. This figure is then combined with the
        precept requirements from the major precepting bodies,
        Hertfordshire County Council and Hertfordshire Police and Crime
        Commissioner, to arrive at the total Council Tax amount due.
    
    2.  The approval of the formal Council Tax resolution by the Council
        Tax Setting Committee is scheduled to take place on the 28
        February 2018 and will authorise the Council Tax billing of the
        residents of North Hertfordshire for financial year 2018/19.

3.  **RISK IMPLICATIONS**
    
    1.  The risk of non-collection of Council Tax is monitored in the
        Collection Fund. The tax base calculations have assumed a
        non-collection rate of 1%.

4.  **EQUALITIES IMPLICATIONS**
    
    1.  In line with the Public Sector Equality Duty, public bodies
        must, in the exercise of their functions, give due regard to the
        need to eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation, to
        advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations
        between those who share a protected characteristic and those who
        do not.
    
    2.  The review and setting of Council Tax is a statutory
        responsibility of this Council. A balance must be considered and
        demonstrated by the Council when setting the level of Council
        Tax and any rise or fall in tax. This said balance is between
        the ability of the individual residents’ to pay the required
        Council Tax and the Council’s need to have sufficient base
        budget to deliver key services across the District. The
        recommendation to provide a grant of approximately £39,000 to
        the District’s Town and Parish Councils will mitigate the impact
        of the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. This action reflects some
        of the considerations made in reaching this balance.

5.  **SOCIAL VALUE IMPLICATIONS**
    
    1.  The Social Value Act and “go local” policy do not apply to this
        report.

6.  **HUMAN RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS**
    
    1.  There are no direct human resource implications arising.

7.  **APPENDICES**
    
    1.  None.
